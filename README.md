Kenshi Zone Informer

An offline application written in Python. Loads prewritten, pre-tagged raw text from a text file and populates appropriate fields in the main window. Supports loading images, which must be pathed in the data file and provided in that path. Image below has all windows open, including the overall map image, which is opened by clicking the top-right most image in the main window.

Images taken from the fandom wiki pages -- I take no credit, also this is a personal project for class.
